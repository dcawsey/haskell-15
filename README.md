# haskell-15
Code for 15 minutes ONLY a day to solve a coding challenge in a language that I wasn't familiar with (lucky me, I got Haskell).

## Problem:
Write a function that will take a given string and reverse the order of the words. “Hello world” becomes “world Hello” and “May the Fourth be with you” becomes “you with be Fourth the May”.

## Running
1. Install Haskell language server and compiler - [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) installs different versions for each and allows you to switch between
2. Run the code:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dcawsey/haskell-15
    cd haskell-15
    ghc Main.hs
    ./Main "enter a string you would like to reverse"
    ```
